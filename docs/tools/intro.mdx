# Tools

In this section, we collect tools for working with legacy code and explain their place in a Mechanized Mending workflow.

## Languages

Our goal is to document a viable toolchain for each of the most common languages in today's production codebases, starting with:

* Java
* C / C++
* Python
* C#
* JavaScript / TypeScript
