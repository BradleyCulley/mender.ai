> Good naming is a process, not a single step

This read-by-refactoring style centers names as the driving force. By gradually capturing insight in code, we bring the components (and their names) to increasing stages of clarity over time. 

1. Missing
2. Obvious Nonsense
3. Honest
4. Completely Honest
5. Does the Right Thing
6. Intent Revealing
7. Domain Abstraction
